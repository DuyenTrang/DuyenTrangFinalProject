Code Book Comments: 
Thanks for listing your variables at the beginning of your script. You may want to consider adding a longer description of your variables, including possible values or a range of values. 
You may also want to include a one sentence description of your data/study


Code Comments: 
Nice code
You may want to consider using scale () to center your variables. If you remove a participant or change your data, your current code will be incorrect. 
Without data, I can’t confirm how your linear models were run. 
Did you make gender a factor? 
Are other variables continuous or factors? 
For your graph, it’s fine to split your variables into factors, but you could also use ggeffects to graph the interaction or graph them continuously with ggplot
There’s no data available to import?
Use scale to center your data rather than your approach. Current approach may lead to errors later.
You can wrap lm with summary to execute it all at once but I think it’s generally a good idea to store your model output and then execute summary on it. You often need your model output later for other purposes. Personal preference, though.
Nice job creating factors out of continuous variables.
